# Service Plans

Service plans provide product clients with a range of service options defined within a preconfigured framework.

Please note that shortly after the implementation of this feature, your customer service flow and solutions may require adjustments due to a system-wide update. Specifically, user records are now enhanced with additional properties, which are described in detail in the latest version of our API reference. For example, users may be placed in an idle state until they confirm the purchase of a plan.

The number of service plans per provider is unlimited, allowing you to create as many plans as needed and customize them extensively. However, plans are designed to reflect standard user attributes while strictly adhering to the corresponding state model.
